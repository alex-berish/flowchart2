ChatObserver — Spin‑Out Proposal (Final) A single, simple structure where Clean Digital captures profit and carries no product risk

Slide slide-02
The Proposal - Operator: Alex's NewCo runs chatobserver product, infrastructure, security, and support (merchant of record + data controller). - Economics: CD keeps 100% of profit forever on CD-sourced accounts. - Profit = cash collected − direct per-account platform costs − payment fees/taxes − granted credits. - NewCo retains zero margin on the CD cohort. - Rationale: CD gains durable upside with no operational drag, no reputation risk, GDPR/operator exposure; NewCo stays investor-ready and ships faster (24/7).

Slide slide-03
Provenance - Origin. Chatobserver.com is made a stronger product by the combination of IP generated by Alex, plus IP belonging to Clean Digital generated during a CD-designated build month. - Structure. To preserve speed and investor cleanliness, NewCo has one director: Alex in his personal capacity. - CD's return. Perpetual 100% of profit on CD-sourced accounts, with transparent reporting.

Slide slide-04
Governance & Conflicts - Disclosure & recusal. Alex declares his NewCo interest to the CD board and EOT trustee board and is recused from all decisions; non-conflicted directors/trustees decide and minutes capture it. - Cap-table clarity. Neither CD nor its employees, officers, directors, or trustees—other than Alex personally—hold equity or governance rights in NewCo. - Arm's-length deal. Consideration flows to CD the company (profit share), avoiding private-benefit conflicts and keeping EOT optics clean.

Slide slide-05
Parties, Roles, Boundaries - Operator. NewCo (merchant of record, controller, support, security, uptime). - Channel. Clean Digital (CD) covers CD-sourced customers. - Brand firewall. Separate brand, domains, repositories, infrastructure, and contracts. - Staffing. No CD staff allocation. - Working pattern. Outside-hours development by Alex (or a one-page daytime override doc confirming the IP remains with NewCo).

Slide slide-06
Core Economics - Perpetual channel right. Applies to every CD-sourced customer. - CD keeps 100% of profit forever. Profit share never steps down on CD-sourced accounts. - Profit definition. Cash collected − direct per-account platform costs (proxies/data/API, per-tenant compute, SMS, per-seat LLM) − third-party payment fees/taxes − customer-specific credits. - Zero margin for NewCo. NewCo earns margins exclusively on non-CD channels.

Slide slide-07
Scope, Attribution, Pricing - CD-sourced customer. (i) Existing CD client at first contact, (ii) direct intro by CD (email/referral link), or (iii) CD-owned landing page signup. - Attribution life. Persists for the life of the paying account; lapses only after >180 days of full churn followed by re-acquisition via a non-CD channel. - Territory. Global; product-wide. - Pricing guardrail. NewCo controls list pricing; a price-floor applies; CD can increase and upsell.

Slide slide-08
Reporting & Audit - Monthly statement. MRR/ARR for CD-sourced accounts; cash collected; direct platform costs by account; fees/taxes; profit remitted to CD. - Audit right. Annual methodology review under mutual confidentiality.

Slide slide-09
GEO / AEO Momentum - AI referrals are real and rising. Analytics increasingly surface chatgpt.com, perplexity.ai, copilot.microsoft.com, and gemini.google.com—even when not every session sends referrers. - Category emergence. GEO/AEO is now a named discipline in agency offerings and tooling (PromptWatch, Peec AI, etc.). - Platform flux. Rapid iteration across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude creates a window for focused analytics before the stack hardens. - Delay costs. First-mover playbooks and partnerships are perishable.

Slide slide-11
- Capital is flowing into GEO/AEO platforms, but the largest players are still early-stage—no incumbent has locked the category. - Velocity is accelerating in 2025; entering now positions Clean Digital as the trusted channel rather than a late follower. - The partnership model delivers exposure to upside without raising external capital to match venture-funded competitors.

Slide slide-13
The Numbers Per CD-sourced account - List price £500/m ; direct costs £90/m (data/proxies/LLM) + £15 fees/tax = £105 direct cost. - Profit per account = £500 − £105 = £395 → 100% to CD . - If CD lands 20 accounts: £7,900/m profit to CD ( £94,800/yr ). - NewCo economics come from non-CD channels; CD pays £0 of NewCo margin on its segment.

Slide slide-14
What We Sign - Deed of Assignment. Transfers the "recipe" to NewCo (execute as deed under Companies Act s.44). - Channel Letter. Defines the perpetual profit share, price-floor, reporting, and audit rights. - Brand Firewall. Locks brand, repositories, infrastructure, and contracts outside CD. - Outside-hours / Daytime override. Confirms the recipe stays with NewCo even if daytime coding is approved. - Conflict minutes & advice. Document disclosure and recusal on both boards; secure independent trustee advice.

Slide slide-15
Decision & Next Steps - Approve the structure. NewCo operates; CD channels CD-sourced customers and receives 100% of profit in perpetuity on that cohort. - Authorise counsel. Draft and execute the Assignment, Channel Letter, Brand Firewall, and Outside-hours/override. - Launch attribution capture. Stand up the CD landing page and referral flow to lock channel attribution. - Start a 2–5-logo pilot. Run under standard SLAs with monthly cost-transparent remittance.
