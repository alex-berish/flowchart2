    actions:
      - "Schedule bi-weekly partner syncs to monitor sentiment."
      - "Draft briefing memo outlining the triggers that would reopen assignment."
      - "Log feedback in the shared diligence tracker."

    optionNumber: 2
    title: "Assign IP to Alex-NewCo; CD acts as Master Reseller"
    narrative: "Transfer the asset to Alex-NewCo with CD retaining a reseller role. This accelerates partner access while keeping CD in the commercial loop."
    implications:
      - "Speed to ship: accelerated under NewCo roadmaps with CD support."
      - "Investor readiness: clearer cap table for future rounds."
    economics:
      - "Revenue share: 70% Alex-NewCo / 30% Clean Digital for year one."
      - "Warrants: CD receives 2% warrant coverage tied to ARR milestones."
    actions:
      - "Draft the assignment term sheet and circulate for review."
      - "Stand up reseller agreement playbook with pricing guardrails."
      - "Notify pilot partners about the operating transition plan."
