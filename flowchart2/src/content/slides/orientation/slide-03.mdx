        <li>
          <strong>Origin:</strong> Chatobserver.com is made a stronger product by the combination of IP generated by Alex, plus IP belonging to Clean Digital generated during a CD-designated build month.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> To preserve speed and investor cleanliness, NewCo has one director: Alex in his personal capacity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CD&apos;s return:</strong> Perpetual 100% of profit on CD-sourced accounts, with transparent reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk:</strong> A large part of development has been aided by looking to competitors for inspiration. Public accusations of "copying", infringement, etc., are a significant risk that is better kept isolated within NewCo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Outcome:</strong> Clean Digital is able to sell chatobserver and associated services to its clients (present and future) in *exactly* the same way as if CD owned chatobserver.
