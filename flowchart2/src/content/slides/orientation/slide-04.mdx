          <strong>Disclosure &amp; recusal:</strong> Alex declares his NewCo interest to the CD board and EOT trustee board and is recused from all EOT decisions related to chatobserver; non-conflicted directors/trustees decide and minutes capture it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cap-table clarity:</strong> Neither CD nor its employees, officers, directors, or trustees—other than Alex personally—hold equity or governance rights in NewCo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arm&apos;s-length deal:</strong> Consideration flows to CD the company (profit share), avoiding private-benefit conflicts and keeping EOT optics clean.
