<FaqPage question="Is this allowed if we're employee-owned?">
  <p>
    Employee ownership does not mean CD owns everything people create outside their core duties, the same way someone could open a coffee shop or web design studio without CD owning it. CD's contribution to ChatObserver (the focused build month plus AI-referral IP) is recognised through a perpetual cash profit share on CD-sourced customers and option to invest in future rounds, all with clean governance.
