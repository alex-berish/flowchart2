<FaqPage question="Doesn't Alex being CD staff and a trustee director create a conflict?">
  <p>
    No. The conflict is managed properly. Alex discloses the NewCo interest, recuses himself from all related decisions on EOT trustee board, and that recusal is minuted. Non-conflicted directors and trustees approve the arm's-length terms.
