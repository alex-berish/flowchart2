<FaqPage question="What counts as a &quot;CD-sourced&quot; customer?">
  <p>
    It means a paying customer who is an existing CD client at first contact, or directly introduced by CD through an email introduction or referral link, or signs up via a CD-owned landing page. Attribution lasts for the life of the account and only lapses after more than 180 days of full churn followed by re-acquisition through a non-CD channel.
