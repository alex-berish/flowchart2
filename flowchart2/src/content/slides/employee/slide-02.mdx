<FaqPage question="Why isn't this kept inside CD?">
  <p>
    ChatObserver is a separate product business that grew mainly from Alex's off-hours work and sits outside CD's core PPC agency remit. Keeping it independent stops CD from becoming the operator or data controller, avoids copyright risk, keeps future VC investment optional, and lets the product ship faster while CD still benefits in the same way.
